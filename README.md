## Extended Abstract:

Ansible is a flexible, highly readable, configuration management tool, which helps administrators consistently deploy and manage an every growing infrastructure.  However, the fact is that Ansible is an open source project, with a 3rd party support structure. VMware supports the APIs, but sadly it's very difficult to extend support to customers using a 3rd party tools that interact with them. The Ansible community has made available several modules and some of them are still in "preview" mode. The other options to quickly integrate DevOps practices into your daily operations is to use a products API.  This is the modern way of interacting with products, and that has it's own set of limitations.

Come join a panel where a VMware customer interviews industry veterans on how they have interacted with vSphere and Ansible.
